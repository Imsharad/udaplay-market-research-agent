When you become a Udacity Mentor, you are making a pact - or formal agreement - to serve students to the best of your ability. Many students choose to enroll in a Udacity Nanodegree program because of the unparalleled support and feedback provided by Udacity’s Student Services Team, of which Mentors are a part.

Project reviews conducted by professionals and content area experts are one of the most sought after aspects of the Udacity program for many students. Having the opportunity to complete real-world projects, receive feedback until they are correct, and graduate with a portfolio of demonstrable, practitioner-level skills prepares Udacity Nanodegree program graduates better than many other companies. To date, more than TWO MILLION projects have been submitted by Udacity students and reviewed by our Mentors.

Students also seek out Udacity for the opportunity to interact with expert Mentors. As you know, mentorship services are provided via Knowledge. Knowledge provides students with a repository of questions and answers related to projects in their Nanodegree program and the opportunity to get connected with a Mentor if they can’t find a satisfactory answer.

However, because students are so excited about this aspect of these offerings, the quality of project review feedback and answers must be delivered at a high standard. As you review projects and/or answer questions that are assigned to you, there are a number of strategies for making your feedback and answers more effective. At Udacity, the best and most effective Mentors make a PACT to provide timely student support that is personalized, accurate, clear, and thorough.

PACT

Defining PACT
All students deserve to receive high quality support that is personalized, accurate, clear and thorough. But what does that mean?

Personalized
Personalized responses and feedback are tailored to meet the specific performance, ability, and background knowledge of students. They provide constructive criticism and praise specific work in the student’s submission, and do not contain any information that does not relate to their submission or question.

Accurate
Accurate responses and feedback provide students with technically sound information that allows them to continue making progress in their Nanodegree program. Any advice, resources, and feedback you provide students should also align to the course materials provided by Udacity.

Clear
Clear responses and feedback ensure that students can benefit from the information you are sharing with them. They organize the information in a thoughtful way and are written in accessible language students’ can understand.

Thorough
Thorough responses and feedback address every part of the submission or question so that students are completely unblocked and ready to move on. They address both explicitly stated and implied questions and anticipate future difficulties the student might face and provide proactive support.

When students get answers and project review feedback that is personalized, accurate, clear, and thorough, they are much more likely to successfully complete their projects and earn their Nanodegree certificate. In the following courses we will provide a number of strategies you can use to ensure your support meets these standards.

PACT in Action
Over the next several courses, we will dive into specific strategies that can be used to ensure your responses to students are personalized, accurate, clear, and thorough. We will also review the standards by which your performance will be evaluated in each of these categories.

It is important to remember that PACT can be applied to any type of review (passing, failing, or ungradeable) and any question on Knowledge. Whenever you are providing a student with any type of feedback, you should consistently check to make sure that what you are sending them is personalized, accurate, clear, and thorough so that you are following through on your pact to provide high quality support.





Many students cite the opportunity to get personalized feedback as one of the main reasons that they choose to learn new skills with Udacity. Providing personalized feedback and responses to students is a key aspect of a Mentor’s role, and one of the best ways to support students to learn and grow. We encourage you to personalize your feedback whenever possible by highlighting specific examples and/or unique aspects of a student’s work, providing student-specific resources and suggestions, and providing an opening note with additional comments related to that student’s submission.

Code reviews, with in-line comments, are naturally personalized and responsive to individual students’ submissions. However, we will focus on how to provide personalized feedback on project reviews and in responses to questions on Knowledge. In the following lessons, you will learn a number of specific strategies that you can use to personalize your feedback and responses to students.

Strategy 1: Highlight Specific Examples and Unique Aspects
One of the easiest ways to personalize your responses to students is to highlight and/or refer to specific aspects of a student’s submission for each comment on project review rubric items. When you call out specific details or examples from a student’s work, it is immediately clear that you have thoroughly read and reviewed their project. This immediately makes students more open to feedback than if they think you only skimmed their work or - worse - didn’t review it at all. Overly general comments without connections to specific parts of a student’s submission can appear to be copy-pasted rather than thoughtfully tailored to provide that student with support.

Example 1 - Effectively Highlighting Specifics of the Student Work

In this example, the Mentor highlights a specific aspect of the student’s work (the explanation of the item ‘e’ in Part III) and reinforces that the student was correct in their explanation. They also provide extra resources that are directly related to the student’s work in Part III, discussing the potential benefits and disadvantages of their chosen method of analysis.

Example 2 - Generic Response Without Student-Specific Examples

This example, however, only provides a very general response that is not tailored to the specific student’s work or submission. Taking a few moments to include specific examples of some of the student’s style errors would indicate that the Mentor had taken the time to thoroughly evaluate the student’s submission rather than simply copy-pasting a generic answer. While it is okay to have some “stock answers” that address commonly-occuring issues in project submissions, taking a few moments to add student-specific information or examples can go a long way towards creating an environment that supports each students’ learning and skill development.

Strategy 2: Provide Student-Specific Resources
In addition to calling out specific aspects of the project that the student excelled at or struggled with, it is important to provide student-specific resources and suggestions. Not every student needs or would benefit from every resource. Ask yourself what suggestions, strategies, and resources would be most helpful based on the skills and knowledge that student has demonstrated on their project. What resources would help break down concepts with which they are struggling? How could they take their new skills to the next level? Remember, whenever you are sharing resources you should take the time to explain why you are sharing them, what parts will be most useful for that specific student, and how they are related to the project or skill at hand.

Example 1- Feedback and Resources Tailored to Student’s Submission

In this example, the Mentor not only referenced specific aspects of the student’s project, but also included screenshots of their work to clarify for the student which part of the code they were referring to. This Mentor was concerned that the range of the z-axis that the student used in their submission was too large. They outlined why they were concerned, and provided specific, detailed suggestions for how the student could change their submission to be more successful in the future. They highlighted what needed to be changed, explained why the changes were important and included additional resources - all directly related to/referencing parts of the student’s submission.

Example 2 - General Comments Without Context

In this example, the Mentor tells the student that they are missing descriptive comments, but does not provide any additional context or information. They link to a Javascript informational site, with information about comments, but they do not explain how this could be applied to the student’s project, places where they would expect to see comments, or examples of the types of comments the student may want to incorporate into their project. This leaves a lot of room for confusion and frustration on behalf of the student if they do not understand how this resource is applicable to their submission. Taking the time to add extra context and information will help students be successful faster.

Strategy 3: Write an Opening Note
Write an Opening Note
When completing a project review, you will have the opportunity to include an opening note with additional comments for the student. This is your opportunity to engage with the student, encourage them, and set the stage for the feedback you are about to provide. Writing a quick opening note can go a long way towards making sure a student is receptive to your feedback in the project review. Similarly, including a short opening on your responses to students’ posts on Knowledge can make them more receptive to the support you provide.

Example 1 - Motivational, Personalized Opening Note for a Passed Project

In the first example, the Mentor provides a general note, however it sets the stage well for the student. The tone is warm and supportive ("I applaud your efforts and hard work"), refers to specific aspects of the student's submission ("the car drives more than 4.0 miles around the track without any incidents and changing lanes in appropriate situations"), and provides additional resources the student can use to further their understanding of the project's topic.

Example 2 - Motivational, Personalized Opening Note for a Failed Project

In the second example, the Mentor provides also sets the stage well for the student. The tone is supportive and straightforward, encouraging the student to correct specific errors that resulted in their failure to meet the rubric requirements and resubmit their project. They indicated that the student needed to make some changes, and provided both general and specific suggestions the student could use to address the problem areas.

Example 3 - Specific, Motivational, Personalized Opening Note

The third example includes even more detail. The Mentor uses a supportive tone, and encourages the student to continue to build their skills by sharing specific strategies related to the skills demonstrated in their submission, as well as resources to help them continue to build their skills. It is very clear, right off the bat, that this Mentor has thoroughly read the student’s submission and is responding to specific aspects of the project. It is clear, professional, and inspires confidence that this Mentor knows what they are talking about and is prepared to provide useful, detailed feedback.

Evaluating Personalization
When your work is audited for quality, one of the first aspects that Auditors will evaluate is whether or not the feedback and responses you provided to students were personalized. Specifically, the Auditor will determine whether or not your commentary was unique to the student’s work and submission, if you provided personalize suggestions, praise and/or resources, and if you included an encouraging and personalized welcome note.

Auditing for Personalized Comments
Auditors will begin by evaluating whether the feedback and insights provided by the Mentor are specific to the student submission being reviewed. If a Mentor only provides non-specific feedback, or comments that could have been written without a diligent review of the student’s work, they will not meet our expectations.


Personalized comments provide detailed thoughts on, and/or references to, unique parts of the student's project. Simply highlighting that the student met the rubric with a cursory "Good Work" or "Awesome", with no elaboration or examples, does not meet this requirement.

If there are two or more specific aspects of the student's project referenced - whether lines of code, analyses, quotes, images from the project, conclusions the student reached, or outputs they created - the Mentor will meet expectations. If there is one or fewer personalized comments or examples from the student’s project, the Mentor will not meet expectations.

Example - Personalized Comments on a Student Project

In this example from the Animal Trading Cards project, the Mentor provided detailed thoughts on multiple parts of the project unique to the student's work. They commented on interesting facts shared by the student on their card, clearly demonstrating that they had read the project and wanted to recognize exemplary work from the student. On these two rubric items alone, the Mentor included three references to specific aspects of the student's submission:

Their choice of animal to focus on (rhinos)
Formatting choices of their card ("cloudy sky background, the yellow borders, and the box shadow")
Specific facts included on the card ("it was surprising to learn their thick skin can be sensitive if they are sunburned or bitten by bugs")
There is no way that this Mentor could have provided this feedback without looking at this specific student's submission. Their responses are personalized to the student and the project submission.

Auditing for Resource Sharing with Context
Constructive feedback and recommendations that are specific to a student’s submission are one of the most valuable parts of project reviews for most students. An experienced human Mentor is able to provide resources, context, suggestions, and more in an effort to help students grow their skills and knowledge. Auditors will work to ensure that students are getting the personalized feedback they deserve.



In order to pass this item during an audit, Mentors must have shared at least two links or resources specifically related to the project and/or student's performance on the project and provided context and explanation for what and why they were sharing them. If there was one or fewer resources shared, the Mentor would not pass this aspect of the quality audit. Adding more than two resources is highly encouraged - any resources you find useful can also help the student better understand the topic and apply it in the future.

Example 1 - Sharing Resources with a Student

In the first example, the Mentor has provided the student with two different resources that are directly related to a skill students are expected to demonstrate during the project. They provide a brief, clear description of why they are sharing each (eg - the first was shared because it included "a good explanation of the importance of nonlinear activations") as well as the link. Providing extra resources to help students continue to improve and grow their skills is one of the many ways Mentors demonstrate added value to our students.

Example 2 - Providing Specific Resources and Suggestions

In the second example, one of the expectations of the rubric item was to ensure the submission "clearly stated the marketing objective and KPI for the Facebook campaign." This student successfully demonstrated the ability to do so, but in order to provide additional color and context about how to effectively select KPIs, the Mentor suggested that the student read a piece from Smart Insights. This type of resource sharing helps students learn how to effectively translate the skills they have learned in Udacity courses to a variety of different projects and topics - at Udacity and beyond.

Example 3 - Sharing Resources in a Code Review

It is also possible - and highly effective - to share resources during in-line comments in a code review. In this example, the Mentor provided an alternate way for the student to set a color value so that it would not change based on user input. This was not a required change, but a suggestion for a more effective way to write the code. In order to ensure the student understood the options being discussed, the Mentor included a link to a Medium article that discussed the differences between let and const, and when to use each most effectively. Showing students multiple strategies to approach a problem or task is incredibly useful as they work to apply their skills in a variety of settings.


Auditing the Opening Note
The goal of an opening note is to set the stage for the review by establishing a rapport with the student. The best way to do this is with an encouraging note that includes information specific to the student’s submission so that it is immediately clear that you have reviewed their work in detail. Encouragement can be especially important for students who have not passed a number of rubric items - the tone of your note could make the difference between them feeling defeated and dropping out or continuing their coursework and successfully completing their Nanodegree program! The opening note should clearly highlight/celebrate at least one specific positive aspect of the student's submission and provide feedback and resources related to next steps for the student.

Auditors will evaluate your opening note using the following criteria.


A good opening note will have many or all of the following elements:

Welcoming and encouraging tone
Discussion of progress the student has made from their last submission (if applicable)
Celebration of the efforts the student has made
Encouragement for the the student to keep working and increasing their skills
Recognition of parts of student’s submission that are unique and/or well done
Summary of the issues (if any) in the project submission
Specific, actionable next steps for a student who failed to take before resubmitting
Resources and/or suggestions that either help the student increase their skills and understanding if they passed, or to better understand how they can better understand the topic for those who failed
The opening note is one of the first parts of the review that a student will see. Establishing a rapport early on and building their confidence - in both themself and in you - will go a long way towards ensuring the student is able to benefit from your feedback.

Example 1 - Unacceptable Opening Note

In this example, the opening note is dull and impersonal. It makes minimal effort to make the student more receptive to the feedback being given, and contains no evidence that the Mentor actually read this specific student’s submission. This Mentor would not meet requirements for either aspect of the quality audit related to the opening note.

Example 2 - Acceptable Opening Note (Failed Project)

In this example, the opening note is clear and concise. The Mentor highlights at least one positive aspect of the student's submission ("you mentioned many times where the reader can find the examples in your code"), specifically calls out several areas of weakness in this specific project submission (lack of descriptions for people without a coding background and missing image output files). Although the Mentor gives context and explanation about why these are important and required skills and provides a resource that the student may find helpful when learning Markdown syntax, they do not list the specific actions the student should take before resubmitting. Their advice was helpful, professional, detailed, and personalized to the student, however including specific examples of things the student needed to change or update would have made this opening note even stronger.

Example 3 - Exemplary Opening Note (Passed Project)

In the third example, the student has passed their project, however the Mentor has still seized the opportunity to provide support and resources for them so that they can continue to expand their skills and understanding. Their tone was warm and encouraging, they highlighted at least one thing the student excelled at in their project submission ("your concepts of DCGAN are crystal clear"), and they provided extra resources - complete with context - for the student to review and internalize at their leisure. The Mentor was encouraging ("keep studying the topic as this is just the beginning" and "here're a few resources to help you continue this wonderful journey.") and made it clear that they were interested in the student's continued growth and skill development. This is an example of an ideal opening note on a student project submission.



Importance of Accuracy
A fast answer or feedback on a project that isn’t technically correct doesn’t help anyone. Accuracy is key to ensuring students have the information they need to continue making progress in their Nanodegree program. Here are some best practices for ensuring accuracy in your responses to students on Knowledge.


Strategy 1: Refer Back to Classroom Content
Your answer should not contain information or links to any information that contradicts any best practices outlined in relevant Udacity course material. To ensure that this doesn’t happen, it is a great idea to refer back to classroom content and direct students to specific lessons or concepts when beneficial.

Pointing students towards a specific topic or module that is specific to what they are working on helps them know exactly where to look to get more information. It also helps students benefit from strategies and information shared in the course without having to search for it. Being familiar with the content helps you be a more successful Mentor.

Example - Referring a Student to a Specific Concept in the Nanodegree Coursework

The Mentor in the example above was unable to grade the student’s project because they did not provide a necessary piece of information. However, rather than simply telling the student to resubmit, they anticipated that the student might struggle when finding the information they were missing. In order to avoid future confusion, the Mentor reminded the student that “a detailed walkthrough” could be found in a specific concept within the Nanodegree program and gave the student the name of the concept they should be looking for.

It is always helpful to be as specific as possible when referring a student back to classroom content, and to provide a summary of what they should be looking for whenever possible.

Strategy 2: Reach Out to Your Peers
We are so proud of the network of dedicated, knowledgeable Mentors that work with Udacity. Mentors come from a variety of different backgrounds and apply their skills and knowledge in countless industries around the world. Asking your peers for support in answering a difficult question or responding to a student’s performance is a great strategy to make sure that the information and feedback you are providing students is accurate. You are always encouraged to post questions in the Mentor community on Student Hub and take advantage of the technical expertise within our community.

Example - Crowdsourcing Peer Support on Student Hub

In this example, a student has submitted a project that is producing an error. The Mentor has reached out to other Mentors certified for that project to see if anyone has suggestions on how to solve the problem so that the student can move forward.

Posting questions on Student Hub allows other Mentors to share possible answers, and helps other Mentors who may have the same question now or in the future. The community on Student Hub is able to tackle a wide range of questions and issues and provide useful tips and tricks for Mentors to use when answering questions or reviewing projects.


Strategy 3: Review Previous Answers and Feedback
When students have a question, they are encouraged to search for the answer before they post it...however sometimes they don’t. Searching Knowledge for similar questions or topics can help you come up with a thoughtful, accurate answer to share with this student. When you are reviewing a project it can also be helpful to get on Knowledge and look at the questions and answers that have been posted by previous students and Mentors. Perhaps someone has already effectively addressed the problem your student is facing, and may provide resources or examples that were helpful.

Because all questions on Knowledge are associated with a specific project, it’s easy to sort and quickly review questions related to that project. If you would like to sort by a specific project, simply select the appropriate Nanodegree program name in the first drop-down field, and the project name in the second drop-down field.


Once you have made your selection, all of the Knowledge questions on your feed will be tagged with the project you selected.


You can also use the search bar at the top of the page to find related queries that can be helpful as you provide students with feedback.


Strategy 4: Ask Udacity Staff for Help
If you’re really stuck, you can always reach out to Udacity staff for help. Filing a Mentor Support Ticket will help us ensure that you are routed to the appropriate staff member to help figure out an answer. Note: We will do our best to reply as soon as possible, however we may not be able to get you an answer before your review or question expires. However, this answer may serve you next time a similar question or issue arises.

To file a Mentor Support ticket, go to http://rebrand.ly/mentor-support(opens in a new tab) and enter your email address, subject, and a description of your issue. Use the drop down menus to indicate that you are a Mentor and select your reason for contact. Adding any specific files that can help us answer your question (including code snippets, PDFs, etc) will help ensure that you get the answer you need as soon as possible. Once you click submit, your question will be sent to our team and we will find the right person to answer it as quickly as we can.

Strategy 5: Search Outside Resources
There are also many great resources available online that can help you answer particularly tough student questions or provide new ways of explaining information or strategies that students need to use to demonstrate their skills. Just make sure that nothing contradicts Udacity’s course content before using them to help provide answers to students.

Some Mentors keep a personal spreadsheet of resources they’ve found helpful so that they can quickly reference it when providing links or other resources to students. Many of you are former students, others are working in the field right now, providing exceptional insight into what resources are most useful for students. We encourage you to share resources you find useful on the Mentors channel on Student Hub as well!




Evaluating Accuracy
Requiring Mentors to submit and pass the project for which they are being certified is our way of ensuring that you have the technical skills necessary to provide accurate feedback and answers to student questions that may arise. Only applicants who are able to demonstrate this technical expertise are certified for a given project. You will have the opportunity to put this expertise to use when reviewing student projects and answering questions on Knowledge. When your work is audited, Auditors will evaluate both your adherence to the project rubric (for project reviews) and the technical accuracy of your responses and feedback.



Auditing Adherence to the Project Rubric
When reviewing a project submitted by a student, you will be provided with a detailed rubric that outlines all expectations the student is expected to meet. It is important that a student’s ability to pass or fail a project is based solely on whether or not they were able to meet the expectations of the project rubric. One aspect of accuracy for which Mentors will be evaluated is whether or not their feedback has adhered to the rubric for that project. Auditors will evaluate the following criteria to determine whether or not a Mentor has adhered to the rubric:


Overall, the Auditor is working to determine whether or not the feedback and results provided to the student are correct and aligned to the rubric. This is the core question an Auditor is asked to answer when evaluating a Mentor’s work

Example 1 - Passing a Rubric Item Incorrectly
In one review for the Data Analyst Nanodegree program, a student was required to meet the following rubric item:

Conclusion Phase: The results of the analysis are presented such that any limitations are clear. The analysis does not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.

The student’s submission did not contain a conclusions section, however the Mentor left the following comment:


This Mentor did not adhere to the rubric when determining whether or not the student should pass. They simply passed the student without regard to their performance on the clearly defined requirements for the project. Because they incorrectly passed this rubric item, the student's project was passed. This Mentor did not meet either of the rubric criteria related to Rubric Adherence.

Example 2 - Feedback Beyond the Rubric Items
In another review, one step of the project was to create a visualization of the distribution of patients by gender. In their submission, the student’s visualizations showed proportions adding up to more than 1 - indicating that the population was 79% female and 80% male.


However, showing a correct distribution in the visualization was not a rubric item for this project. While it would be ideal for the Mentor to point out the student’s error, it is not required. The Mentor will not be penalized for not correcting this student because Mentors are not required to provide feedback on aspects of the student’s project outside of what is expressly required by the rubric. In fact, Mentors should only pass or fail a rubric item, and the entire project, based on exactly what is required by the rubric. If the student is able to successfully meet the requirement, even if you think there is a different or better way that they could have met the goal, you should pass the rubric item.

When reviewing a project, your first goal is to read, assess student performance, and provide technically correct feedback on each and every rubric item. Once you have met this goal, you are free to provide additional feedback to students beyond the requirements in the rubric for that project. However, no decisions about whether or not to pass a student's submission should be based on anything other than the rubric requirements.

Auditing Technically Accurate Responses to Students
When auditing your ability to provide accurate responses to student questions on Knowledge and feedback on project reviews, our team will also seek to determine whether or not the response was technically accurate. Giving students technically correct answers supports their learning, while answers that contain inaccurate information can lead to a great deal of confusion and frustration for the student. Although it can be helpful to provide additional information, strategies, or resources, at the end of the day it is important that you only pass or fail a student based on the specific criteria outlined in the project rubric.

Auditors will use the following rubric to determine whether or not the information you have provided to the student is technically sound.


As mentioned above, Auditors are instructed to evaluate technical accuracy within the comments provided by the Mentor/Mentor. They should not penalize a Mentor for failure to flag a part of the student’s project submission unless it is specifically required by the rubric.

The two most common cases of technical inaccuracy that you should always work to avoid are misunderstanding the rubric requirements and giving incorrect advice. If you have questions about what a rubric item means, please reach out to the Mentor Operations team so that we can provide the context you need to effectively support your students.

Example - Inaccurate Evaluation of Student Performance
In one project submission for the Data Analyst Nanodegree program, the rubric requirement was that “The code makes use of functions to avoid repetitive code. The code contains good comments and variable names, making it easy to read.” However, the project that the student submitted included a great significant repetition of code and did not include functions. The Mentor provided the following feedback:


This feedback was inaccurate and therefore unacceptable. The student was provided with feedback that was technically incorrect, which prevented them from better understanding what was expected of them. Telling a student that they have met a requirement when that is not the case is a common mistake that Mentors make, so it is critically important that each rubric item is thoroughly read and evaluated, and only passed when every aspect of the rubric item is met.

Applying Personalization and Accuracy
Applying PACT as a Mentor
Throughout your time at Udacity, you will apply PACT as you answer questions on Knowledge or provide feedback on project submissions during reviews.

The first project will ask you to identify and apply strategies related to personalization and accuracy in order to improve your feedback and responses to students.

Completing Project 1
Completing Your Assessment
You will be required to answer all six (6) questions. Some questions have multiple parts, so please make sure you read carefully and answer each question in its entirety.

You will be provided with a project template(opens in a new tab) that contains all questions and any information or background you need to be able to answer them. When you click on the template, you will be prompted to create a copy of the template which will be used to input and submit your final responses.

Each question will have a yellow box in which you are expected to provide an answer, like the one provided below. Be sure that you have put an answer in each yellow box before submitting.


Your final project should be submitted as a PDF file. It will be reviewed by a Senior Mentor using a rubric to determine whether or not you have been able to effectively apply what you have learned to real-life examples of student work. You are welcome to reference the materials from this course, however you are expected to write things in your own words.

When your project is complete and saved as a PDF file, you will submit it by clicking the blue SUBMIT PROJECT button at the top right corner of the page.


Click the GO TO SUBMISSION button on the pop up and follow the directions for submitting your project.

Importance of Clarity
If your answers are personalized, accurate, and thorough but written in a way that is inaccessible to students, they still won’t be able to benefit from your expertise and experience. Taking the time to ensure your answer is clear and concise will be the most beneficial and impactful for students. In this course we will share a few ideas for how to increase the clarity of your responses to student questions on Knowledge and feedback sent to students during project reviews.


Strategy 1: Write in Accessible Language
Write in Accessible Language
Remember that some students are beginners in your program, or may be unfamiliar with some of the technical vocabulary you use. You should always try to write in accessible language, and explain any concepts or vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to a novice learner. Providing step-by-step details and instructions, preferably using numbered or bulleted lists, helps students more easily get to their end goal. Code can also be included to help the student better understand the directions. Additional suggestions can also be included in case the proposed answer does not work.

Example 1 - Accessible Language in Project Reviews

While this Mentor uses technical vocabulary appropriate for, and related to, the course at hand, their feedback is clear, concise, and accessible to the student. Their use of a bulleted list will help the student understand exactly what they need to change in their project. This is especially important when the student fails to meet criteria and will be required to submit the project again.

Example 2 - Accessible Language in Knowledge Responses

In this case, a student posted on Knowledge that they were struggling to activate an environment that they needed in order to complete their project. The Mentor gave clear, numbered instructions that informed the student about exactly what they needed to do in order to be successful. The Mentor also included an alternate solution/strategy at the end of their response, anticipating that the student might still struggle and need additional help. Anticipating questions and answering them up front reduces potential back and forth with the student, especially on Knowledge.


Strategy 2: Share Useful Resources and Multiple Examples
Sharing outside resources, where concepts are broken down and explained in a different way, can be extremely helpful for students who are confused. Please just remember to check and ensure that anything you share is aligned to Udacity coursework and materials. You should also be sure to add your own summary or context for any outside resources you share. Giving a student a link for them to read on their own is not as helpful or effective as calling out specific sections a student may want to review and indicating how it is directly related to the project at hand.

Example 1 - Multiple Examples in Project Reviews

Always keep in mind that different students learn and think differently, and many times there may be multiple ways to solve a problem. You can avoid back and forth with students by providing more than one example in your initial response so that the student has an even better change of understanding the feedback you are providing,


When a student posted on Knowledge with a question about why their code was not working, the Mentor saw their error right away. They explained the issue to the student and provided two alternate code snippets that would yield the correct result.


Strategy 3: Use Correct Spelling and Grammar
Correct spelling and grammar can go a long way to making sure students are able to understand the information you’re sharing with them. Built-in spell checkers on browsers or word processors can help you make sure you are spelling words correctly. Resources like Grammarly(opens in a new tab) have built AI-powered writing assistants that check your grammar as you go and can provide insight into your tone as well. There are many resources available to help in this area.


Strategy 4: Use Formatting in Your Responses
Formatting can also be extremely helpful to students when it is used in responses to students. Both Knowledge and the Reviews Portal allow Mentors to use markdown syntax to highlight code or technical terms when responding to a student. You are encouraged to use bold lettering to call attention to key points or words, and employ bullet points or numbered lists to help separate details and lead to quicker student understanding. Remember, emojis should be used sparingly. Thoughtful use of emojis can add flair and highlight great work, remember that you want to be professional!

Example 1 - Formatting in Project Reviews

In this example, the Mentor uses multiple forms of formatting to hit home their points. Code is highlighted using markdown syntax, there is a bulleted list to separate out key points to the student, and emojis are sparingly and effectively used to highlight what the student has done well.

Example 2 - Formatting in Knowledge Responses

This Mentor on Knowledge has effectively used bold lettering to highlight key points, and has made bulleted lists that help the student better understand the answer to their question. This formatting will help draw the student’s eye to the most important information so they are able to answer their question and continue in their Nanodegree program.


Strategy 5: Use Visual Aides
While some students are able to easily process and understand writing, others benefit more from visual aids. Don’t be afraid to include code snippets or screenshots that help illustrate a strategy or explain why an issue occurs and/or how to fix it.

Example 1 - Code Snippets in Project Reviews

In the example above, the Mentor includes a code snippet within their comments on a student’s code in their project submission. Giving students a clear example of another strategy that they can use helps them continue to grow and generalize the skills they have acquired, applying them to new situations and challenges.

Remember: You should not be giving the students the exact code or answer to provide in their next submissions. Your goal is to guide them towards an answer and provide additional strategies or tips that they may find useful in the future.

Example 2 - Code Snippets in Knowledge Responses

In this example, a Mentor uses a code snippet to respond to a student’s question on Knowledge. They clearly provide a strategy a student can use to overcome a problem they are facing when attempting to run their code. They even provide an additional tip at the end to help the student further!

Example 3 - Screenshots in Project Reviews

In this review of a project for the Self Driving Car Nanodegree program, the Mentor used screenshots to show the students how their car would parallel park, based on the code provided, as compared to a screenshot of what the ideal outcome would look like. This helps illustrate for the student exactly how they fell short of expectations. The Mentor then goes on to provide an explanation of why the student’s car is not performing as expected, and provided an example of an alternate strategy the student could learn from before resubmitting their project.

Example 4 - Screenshots in Knowledge Responses

The best Mentors combine screenshots with an explanation of what students should be looking at/for on the web page. In the example above from the Digital Marketing Nanodegree program, the Mentor used a screenshot to help the student more clearly see the steps they need to take in order to solve their problem. Accompanying the screenshots with step-by-step directions will ensure the student is ready to solve their issue and move on in their courses.


Evaluating Clarity
Mentors will be evaluated to determine whether or not they are able to address student questions and performance with clarity. There are two aspects of clarity that will be evaluated by Auditors: Clear Language and Formatting.




Auditing Clarity of Language
During audits, Auditors will use the following rubric to measure whether or not a Mentor is using clear language.


Put yourself in the student's shoes - what is the simplest, clearest way for you to explain your point?

Udacity is home to a global community of Mentors and students. Although our project submissions and questions - and Mentors' responses to them - are mostly in English, this is not the first language for many. Using simple, clear vocabulary, as well as proper grammar and spelling, can go a long way towards helping a student understand the new concepts and strategies they are learning in their Nanodegree program.

Sometimes, typos or mis-spellings happen. However your goal should always be to limit any errors or word choice that could lead to confusion on the part of the student. Auditors have been directed to critically evaluate whether or not student understanding is truly impacted by what the Mentor has said. Rather than focusing on specific word choice, they are asked to look at the overall messaging and determine whether or not the response was written in a confusing or unclear manner.

Example 1 - Unclear Language in a Project Review

As the Mentor responded to the code in this student’s submission, they selected that a change was required, however they began their comment by saying it was recommended. This language choice is likely to confuse the student. A change that is required means that their project did not pass and they must resubmit. A change that is recommended or suggested is usually an opportunity for a student to apply a new strategy or skill, but the way that the student did it in the submission meets the expectations of the rubric and they pass that rubric item. Taking time to ensure language matches and is straightforward and clear is extremely helpful to the students. The language the Mentor used was also confusing, and may hinder the student's ability to understand and integrate this feedback.


Auditing Formatting for Clarity
A well formatted response to a student - whether in a project review or in response to a Knowledge question - helps students understand and progress more quickly.


In well-formatted responses, the Mentor consistently uses markdown syntax for bullet points, bold lettering, italics, and code blocks. Their review is easily interpretable, tidy, and easy to read. Key points and aspects of the feedback are called out for the student visually.

Example - Poorly Formatted Feedback

In this example the Mentor includes strange, unnecessary line breaks that make the feedback harder to follow and understand. They do not utilize any other formatting to ensure that their messaging is clear to the student.


Importance of Thoroughness
It is important to ensure that every aspect of a student’s post on Knowledge or project’s rubric is addressed. When answering questions on Knowledge, Mentors should take care to ensure that every aspect of a student’s question is answered. If step A is missing, students won’t be able to apply steps B, C, and D. The best Mentors provide thorough, detailed answers that touch on every question or concern raised by the student.

When evaluating a project submission, Mentors are expected to address whether or not a student successfully met each expectation outlined in a project rubric, and provide feedback on them all. Sometimes, providing a thorough answer requires Mentors to make inferences about what a student is actually asking and/or anticipating and addressing follow up/future questions whenever possible.

This course will be focused on strategies for providing students with thorough feedback and responses. Some strategies can be applied to both project reviews and Knowledge posts, while others are specific to one or the other.


Strategy 1: Break Down the Question or Issue
While it would be helpful for every student to provide a bulleted or numbered list of questions and concerns as part of their Knowledge post or response to a rubric item, this doesn’t always happen. The best Mentors are prepared to break down students’ posts and projects into discrete questions or sections - whether specifically written out or implied. Do your best to determine what exactly the student is saying so that you are prepared to address it.

When reviewing projects, the rubric is your best tool for structuring feedback to students. They are specifically designed to help you evaluate whether or not students demonstrated all of the target skills for that project. Some rubric items contain multiple discrete tasks or aspects of a project that you are meant to assess. When checking to determine whether or not these criteria are met, it is important to only pass that rubric item if every requirement has been met.

Example - Addressing Every Part of a Project Rubric

In this rubric, the first rubric item required five separate criteria to be met. In the student’s submission, they only included four of the five criteria. Therefore, the Mentor marked the rubric item as requiring changes, and gave specific feedback about both what the student did well and what they were missing. Formatting simply further drew the student’s eye to the thoroughness of the response and informed them of exactly what they needed to do in order to be successful on their next submission.


In this example, you can see that the student’s Knowledge post included three separate questions or concerns. Although many students do not, this student listed out their questions clearly on a numbered list. The Mentor was sure to address each individual part, and numbered the answers so that they clearly correlated to the questions being raised. This is an excellent strategy for both thorough and clear answers.

Strategy 2: Go Beyond the Minimum
You don’t have to write a novel, but one sentence answers show a lack of effort. Providing context or additional details helps students with their current question, and better prepares them for future application of these skills - at Udacity and beyond. Including extra tips and resources for students shows your expertise and makes the student feel like you are invested in their success.

Example - Going Above and Beyond on Project Reviews

In this example, the student’s submission met the requirements of the rubric. Since the student demonstrated the necessary skill, the Mentor indicated that the rubric item “meets requirements”. However, the Mentor also went above and beyond to provide the student with an additional resource where they could further improve their SQL skills. The Mentor explained why they shared the resources and provided a specific example of an alternate strategy explained within the links that was directly applicable to this project. Providing extra opportunities for students to build their skills is one way in which Mentors can ensure students are thoroughly supported.


Strategy 3: Share and Summarize External Resources
Whenever you provide external resources to students, it is best to also summarize what they include or explain. Simply providing a link is not enough - students are relying on you to do more than Google! The best Mentors tell students why they found the resource helpful and/or direct them to a specific part or area that will help answer their question.

Example 1 - Effective Resource Sharing in a Code Review

During their code review of a student’s project submission, this Mentor suggested a different way to save their file so that they could view the formatting provided by Markdown syntax. They provided several resources that the student could review in order to become more familiar with Markdown, and indicated the sections or topics from which they felt the student would benefit the most.

Example 2 - Ineffective Resource Sharing on Knowledge

In this example, the Mentor provided a student on Knowledge with a link to a Stack Overflow thread related to their question, however it was provided without any additional explanation. A simple online search conducted by the student would have yielded the same results, and may have still left the student confused and unable to progress in their coursework. Mentors are much more valuable resources than an internet search. Providing additional context, explanation, and information along with external resources ensures that students are able to make the most of them and apply the new information to their work.


Strategy 4: Anticipate Future Questions
Whether answering a student’s question on Knowledge or breaking down a concept with which a student needs more practice in a project review, it is always helpful to try and anticipate future questions that may arise and answer them before the student has reached the point of confusion or frustration. If you can attempt to anticipate future questions or issues that a student might have and try to address them in your initial comment or answer, you may be able to prevent the need for back-and-forth with the student that further delays their learning and progress.

Additionally, some students struggle to fully articulate their question or confusion. It is often necessary for Mentors to try to infer what they might be asking now, as well as the information they might need next. Reflect on what it was like the next time you learned a new skill or concept. Sometimes you don’t yet have the vocabulary necessary to ask for the help you need. Trying to put yourself in their shoes can help you better understand what they are asking and how you can help.

The longer you act as a Mentor, the more project submissions and questions on Knowledge you will come across. If you consistently notice that students are having issues with a specific aspect of a project, you will be better prepared to anticipate questions or stumbling blocks the student may encounter in the future. Taking time to provide feedback that students can use to correct their mistakes on subsequent submissions is especially helpful.

Example 1 - Anticipating Future Questions in a Project Review

In this example, the student required changes in order to successfully meet that item on the project rubric. However, the Mentor noted that if the student continued with their current strategy, they would run into additional difficulties when attempting to correct their project submission. Rather than letting the student submit again without addressing the issue, the Mentor explained potential challenges the student might face and provided guidance on how the student could overcome or address them.

Example 2 - Repercussions of Not Anticipating Questions on Knowledge

In this example, the Mentor provides only short answers and fails to provide the student with the information they need to continue making progress and overcome the roadblock they are facing. This results in a great deal of back and forth between the student and their Mentor, delaying the student from moving forward in their project/coursework. Rather than simply instructing the student to “try another instance_type”, the Mentor could have provided examples and supplementary resources as part of their initial answer. This would have likely allowed the student to resolve their issue faster and more effectively.



Strategy 5: Check Previous Answers and Reviews
Looking at feedback previous Mentors left, both on previous submissions of the project and related Knowledge questions, can be extremely helpful. If a student failed to meet specifications for that rubric item in their new submission, you can reiterate the previous Mentor’s feedback, but it should be in your own words.

Ask yourself: Can I think of a different way to explain it to the student? Perhaps they didn’t understand the previous Mentor’s feedback and now have the opportunity to hear feedback in a different way

Sometimes it takes a student several different explanations to understand a new topic. That is one of the benefits of having multiple Mentors ready and able to grade your project. Different students have different backgrounds, levels of understanding, reference points, etc. If a student hasn't passed a project rubric item again, or feels their question wasn't adequately answered on Knowledge, it is your opportunity to present the information in a new way that might finally "click."

When completing a project review, you will also have the opportunity to peer rate previous Mentors by going to the "Project History" tab on the submission. Providing feedback on other Mentors’ performance gives them the opportunity to improve upon their weaknesses or areas of confusion and reinforces areas in which they’ve given excellent feedback and support to students.

Searching on Knowledge to find related questions and seeing what strategies and resources Mentors previously used to explain or break down similar concepts can also be a great strategy when working to frame a response to a student. Examples from Knowledge can help you when answering a new question on the platform or providing useful, actionable feedback to students on their project reviews.


Strategy 6: Thoughtfully Choose Between Answer and Comment
When responding to a student’s question on Knowledge, Mentors have the option of electing to provide an “answer” or “comment” for the post.


It is very important that you do not submit an answer unless you have an answer to every part of the student’s question. If you don’t have the information you need to check all the boxes, ask for clarification from the student by posting a comment or seek help from your peers or Udacity staff before posting an answer.

There will be situations where students don’t give you all of the information or context you need to answer their questions. In these cases, we encourage you to utilize the comment feature to ask for more information. Remember to be as specific as possible, and ask all of your questions of the student in a single comment. Then, when the student replies you will be able to provide them with the full answer to every question.


A comment should be used only when additional details are required in order to answer a student’s question. Be specific and clearly state what additional info a student needs to provide for the question to be successfully answered. Mentors who make the initial comment, have 24 hours after the student replies to provide an answer to the question.


Use the answer feature as soon as you have sufficient information to provide an answer. Your answer should address every part of the student’s question. To ensure students have all the info they need from the initial answer, make sure that your answer is personalized, accurate, clear, and thorough.

Strategy 7: Read Student Notes on Project Reviews
Students often leave notes, including specific questions or context clues, which can help you tailor your project review feedback to meet their specific needs. If a student has left a specific question in their notes, you should always try to address it somewhere in your review. This helps students feel heard and as though your attention was given to every part of their submission.


You can view notes from a student on the Student Notes tab of the project review. Not all students leave notes, but it is always helpful to try and address any issues they note somewhere in your project review. This Mentor made sure to address the issue that the student raised during their review of rubric items, asking the student some questions to guide them towards the solution. They even provided a link with more information that could help the student overcome their issue with empty strings.

Evaluating Thoroughness
Mentors will be evaluated to determine whether or not they have thoroughly reviewed students’ project submissions and provided thoughtful and thorough answers to student questions on Knowledge. There are two main areas that will be evaluated to determine whether a Mentor is thorough when reviewing projects and addressing Knowledge questions: did the Mentor comment on more than 50% project’s rubric items, and were the comments provided by the Mentor helpful to the student.

Auditing Quantity of Rubric Items with Feedback
The expectation is that Mentors will address every single aspect of the rubric for project reviews. When a Mentor’s performance is audited, the Auditor will evaluate whether or not the Mentor has provided comments for each part of the rubric.


During this section of performance audits, Auditors are evaluating the quantity of comments, irrespective of the quality. Auditors will look at the total number of rubric items and award points based on whether or not the Mentor has met the requirement based on the specific project they are auditing.

For example, the Intro to Programming Nanodegree program has a project called Animal Training Cards. This project’s rubric has 5 points, so a Mentor that provides comments for 3 or more of the rubric points would meet specifications. However for the Investigate a Dataset project in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program has 10 rubric points. Therefore, a Mentor would need to leave comments on at least 6 rubric points in order to meet the requirement. Any review for this project with 5 or less comments would not meet specifications.

It is important to note that a project with 5 comments across 10 Rubric points (exactly 50%), does not meet specifications. The best way to ensure that you meet the requirement every time - and provide the most thorough support to students - is to leave comments on every single rubric item.

Example 1 - Mentor Addresses a Sufficient Number of Rubric Items

In this example, the Mentor has commented on 4 out of the 5 rubric items (80%), which surpasses the 50% necessary to meet the requirement. Even though not every comment provides in-depth feedback (eg- the final comment simply says “Great job writing neat code!”) this part of the evaluation is simply about whether or not a comment was made. Although this Mentor provided additional comments on the code review, they will not be taken into consideration for this part of the quality audit. The Auditor will only focus on the number of comments and total number of rubric items.

Example 2 - Mentor Does Not Address a Sufficient Number of Rubric Items

In this example the Mentor has not left any comments. There are five rubric items, which the student has passed, but the Mentor has provided no additional information. While it may sometimes be easier to come up with comments for rubric items that fail to meet specifications, such as suggestions for what the student can change or improve, it is still important to provide supporting comments for rubric items on which the student has met specifications. You can use this opportunity to highlight exemplary work in the student’s submission, provide alternate acceptable answers, and/or share resources that the student is able to use to continue developing their skills.

Again, although the Mentor has left comments on the Code Review, the Auditor will only be evaluating whether or not they commented on at least 50% of the rubric items on the Review tab during this stage of the audit.

Auditing for Quality of Feedback
During the next stage of audits, Auditors will evaluate whether or not the comments that were left by the Mentor are actually helpful to the student. While the last stage concentrated on quantity, this step is all about quality.


What is a helpful comment? A helpful comment is one which provides detailed additional context. In summary, it gives the what and/or the why regarding the rubric. Helpful comments do more than just reiterate the rubric point. They explain what the student did to meet the rubric criteria, or what they were missing that resulted in them requiring changes. Helpful comments also explain why the rubric point is important - to the project or the overall goal or skill the student is working to develop.

There are many ways to write comments that are helpful for students. Many Mentors use the following format to structure their comments in situations where students have not met the requirements of a rubric item:

Reiterate the requirement.
Explain what the student did that failed to meet the requirement.
Explain why the requirement is necessary.
For example when a student failed to meet the rubric item that required them to provide reasoning for each analysis decision, plot, and statistical summary, one Mentor responded “Each figure you created should be followed by a brief commentary describing the findings you distilled from that plot. You have done that for most plots, but it is still missing in some cases. Including your reasoning ensures that the recipient of your analysis understands the steps you took to analyze the data and all of the information you are sharing. Please consider this issue for the next submission.” The Mentor began by reiterating the requirement, then told the student exactly what they needed to change in order to meet the requirement on a future submission. They explained why the rubric requirement was important and encouraged them to fix their error and resubmit.

When Mentors leave comments for rubric items that have passed, many Mentors use the following structure:

Praise the student for the specific steps they took to meet the rubric requirement.
Explain why this requirement is important for the project, or application of this skill to future problems.
(Optional) Share additional resources where students can further develop associated skills.
On another submission, a student successfully met requirements on a rubric item that required them to provide varied visualizations that showed at least two comparisons and trends, including relevant statistics that were computed throughout the analysis when inferences were made about the data. The Mentor responded “You have provided the varied plot types as required. Your plots are neat and easy to interpret.” This response praised the student by indicating exactly what they did to meet the rubric criteria and highlighted why it was important to meet this requirement - it demonstrated their ability to visualize data in a way that was easy to interpret and understand.

Example 1 - Mentor Provides Helpful Comments

In this example the Mentor’s comments are predominantly thoughtful and helpful. The comments include adequate context and do not simply reiterate the rubric. Comments in this review go much beyond, "Good Job.” The Mentor compliments the student's patience and determination, talks about why using varied plots are important, and cites a resource with appropriate context so that the student is prepared to benefit from it. Regardless of how many comments overall the Mentor left, the majority of their comments were helpful, and therefore they would pass this requirement during their audit.

Example 2 - Mentor Does Not Provide Helpful Comments

In this example, however, the Mentor’s comments are predominantly unhelpful. They mostly just reiterate the rubric and lack context. In unhelpful reviews, most of the comments only address the bare minimum of what the student did. They do not provide information about what a student needs to change when they have failed to meet requirements on a rubric item, and some even further confuse students by indicating they require changes along with a copy-pasted comment such as “Great job!”

Usually, unhelpful comments essentially reiterate the rubric and do not talk about why that rubric is important to meet, or share any helpful resource. While these reviews may include a couple helpful comments, generally most of the comments are unhelpful. Auditors are asked to evaluate whether or not the Mentor provided helpful comments for at least three rubric items - regardless of whether or not the student passed those rubric items. If they have not, the Mentor will not meet the requirements of this stage of the audit.

Applying Clarity and Thoroughness
Applying PACT as a Mentor
It is critical to always try to apply all aspects of PACT you answer questions on Knowledge or provide feedback on project submissions during reviews.

The second project will ask you to identify and apply strategies related to clarity and thoroughness when providing feedback and responses to students.


Completing Project 2
Completing Your Assessment
You will be required to answer all five (5) questions. Some questions have multiple parts, so please make sure you read carefully and answer each question in its entirety.

You will be provided with a project template(opens in a new tab) that contains all questions and any information or background you need to be able to answer them. When you click on the template, you will be prompted to create a copy of the template which will be used to input and submit your final responses.

Each question will have a yellow box in which you are expected to provide an answer, like the one provided below. Be sure that you have put an answer in each yellow box before submitting.


Your final project should be submitted as a PDF file. It will be reviewed by a Senior Mentor using a rubric to determine whether or not you have been able to effectively apply what you have learned to real-life examples of student work. You are welcome to reference the materials from this course, however you are expected to write things in your own words.

When your project is complete and saved as a PDF file, you will submit it by clicking the blue SUBMIT PROJECT button at the top right corner of the page.


Click the GO TO SUBMISSION button on the pop up and follow the directions for submitting your project.


Please Note
You will not be able to graduate from this Nanodegree (a pre-requisite to becoming a Mentor at Udacity) until you pass this project.

All work is expected to be done individually, and include only work you have done yourself. If there is any evidence that you have plagiarized any part of your project, you will no longer be eligible to provide mentorship services at Udacity.
