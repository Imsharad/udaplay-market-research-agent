PACT in Action: Project 2

### Question 1
Use Markdown syntax to apply the following formatting.


**a. Make the word "ready" bold in the phrase "I am ready to be a Mentor."** 
I am **ready** to be a Mentor


**b. Make the word "excited" italicized in the sentence "I am excited to support students."**
I am *excited* to support students


**c. Create a bulleted list that includes three reasons why you want to be a Mentor.**
- Being a mentor allows me to support students and help me give back to society
- Young students have contagious energy that helps me achieve two goals: "Forever a learner" and "Its always day one"
- It's incredibly rewarding to see mentees grow, succeed, and apply what they've learned


**d. Create an in-line style link for www.udacity.com that displays as Udacity.**
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)

### Question 2
Look at the example of feedback to a student on Knowledge shown below. 
The most important aspect of Data Wrangling is to clean or transform the data, preparing it for analysis. One main issue is having missing data while conducting the analysis, which can skew or bias results. The first thing to do is to always identify the missing values within the dataset (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.isnull.html). Once you have found the missing data, you can do the following. If there are columns with a few rows of missing data, the Dropna method (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html) could be used to drop the missing rows. If there are rows with missing data, the Fillna method ( http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) can be used instead of dropping them completely. Note: This method can vary with the data and the project. 


How could you make this feedback easier for the student to understand using only formatting changes? In the space below use Markdown to add formatting that would help the student.

Do not change any of the content - simply use spacing, bold and/or italics, bulleted lists, and links to make the information easier for the student to understand.

The first thing to do is to always identify the missing values within the dataset. Once you have found the missing data, you can do the following:

- If there are columns with a few rows of missing data, the [`dropna` method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html) could be used to drop the missing rows.
- If there are rows with missing data, the [`fillna` method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) can be used instead of dropping them completely.

*Note: This method can vary with the data and the project.*

### Question 3
Look at the Knowledge post from a student below. In this example, the student asked multiple questions, all of which should be answered by the Mentor to whom the question is assigned.

Provide a list of each question the student asked.  Note: You are not being asked to answer the questions, only identify them.
- What are the requirements for the travel app submission: is the name of the place or the postal code needed?
- What are the requirements for the weather forecasting feature: what results should be displayed after a successful API response?

### Question 4
When project reviews are checked for thoroughness, you are asked to evaluate both the quantity of responses and the quality of responses. Use the two sections of a project review below to answer parts 4a and 4b below. 


**a. Does the Mentor provide feedback for more than 50% of the project rubric?**
Yes. Based on the project review image, the mentor provided feedback on 6 out of 9 total rubric items. This is more than the 50% threshold required for this check.


**b. Give a summary of at least 3 specific situations where the student did not meet the rubric requirement and the feedback or explanation that the Mentor provided the student about why they did not meet that requirement.**
Here are three examples from the review where the student did not meet the requirements:

1.  **Rubric Item:** Markdown Formatting
    **Mentor Feedback Summary:** The student's submission for the bold and italic text was incorrect. Instead of wrapping the words in asterisks, the student bolded and italicized the entire sentences.

2.  **Rubric Item:** Markdown Formatting
    **Mentor Feedback Summary:** The student did not correctly create a bulleted list. The submission was a single paragraph, not a list with bullet points.

3.  **Rubric Item:** Formatting for Clarity
    **Mentor Feedback Summary:** The student did not use Markdown to make the text easier to read. The submission was a single block of text with no formatting, and the links were not active.

### Question 5
When answering a student's questions on Knowledge, or addressing concerns or shortcomings on project reviews, why is it important to try to anticipate future questions?
By being able to predict the next blocker you are actively trying to guage the student's current knowledge graph. This information can further amplify the ability to personalise a learning experience that suits them.
